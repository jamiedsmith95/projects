The most unforgettable? A man's pimpled back caressed by nail-polished hands, hinting at intimacy. Being a curious kid, I pieced together a hilarious theory: Pimples on the back = AIDS.

Then one day, I saw my dad shirtless. Lo and behold, he had pimples on his back! My shocked yelp? ""Dad has AIDS!""

Parents had a tough time explaining that one.

**TL;DR:** Misinterpreted a 90s PSA, freaked out thinking my dad had AIDS because of some back pimples!"

173rec3,173rec3,Natural_Health555,77,40,The WEIRDEST thing happened to me with a cat last night.,"Just for a bit of backstory I was walking down the street towards my ground-floor flat the other day and I came across a little cat who looks just like my family cat 200 miles away from where I live. It definitely belongs to someone as it had a little bell on its collar and it wasn’t afraid of me. It didn’t say hello as it was just exploring it’s area so I let it be after trying to say hi. 

Now HERE is where it gets weird:

Last night, at about 3AM, I woke up to a jingle in my room, I thought I imagined it so went back to sleep. Next thing I know I hear it again, wake up and see the SAME cat standing IN my bedroom by the door. The little guy had let himself in through my open window and was just casually roaming around my bedroom like. He even jumped onto my bed, said hello, and head bumped my hand as I gave him sleepy scratches. I was half asleep and also very baffled as to why it decided my bedroom was a cool place to explore (especially as I have a blind that covers the window). I had to let him out so opened the blind and picked him up and plonked him outside the window. He didn’t protest once he was very docile…. I just stared at him outside my window thinking “did that just happen?” I wanna know why this cat decided “yes this is a cool place to hang out, I think I am going to claim this bedroom” and the fact he looks exactly like my cat at home.

Weirdest experience of my life to date."

My boyfriend and I were laughing about this situation today; It’s been a few months since this happened and I still can’t believe it actually did. I (f20) was at my boyfriend’s(m21) father’s funeral service. He and his sister were sat directly in front of their mom (divorced) and I. 

The funeral director announced that they were going to open the floor to any friends/family who wanted to share stories or kind words, and asked that they keep it under a few minutes so they could give everyone who wanted to share a chance. 

At one point, the mic got passed to a close friend, we will call him Mike. He started by sharing some nice stories, how close they were, how they met; it was very sweet. Once a few minutes had passed, already more than his share of time, the director started noticeably looking at his wrist and sort of gesturing that we would need to keep moving. Mike kept trucking on.

Another minute passed and Mike began another story about how bf’s father and him would sing karaoke together. The director stood up and looked at his nonexistent watch to speed him up. Again.

Everyone in the room could get a sense of where Mike was going, but nobody could truly believe it was going to happen. It was truly surreal.

Mike mentioned one instance where he and bf’s father had made a pact, that whoever was present at the other’s funeral would have to sing. Yes. He started singing. He started SINGING! 

The director gave an exasperated sigh, sat back on the bench, and there were hushed chuckles among the crowd.  My boyfriend started quietly laughing and his mom kicked his seat a few times. Mike sang for what felt like five minutes (probably closer to 3). The tension in the air was so thick, everyone trying to contain themselves. 

It was a scene straight out of a movie.

After he finished, the director took back the mic and they continued passing it around.

I’d like to add that bf’s father would have found this hilarious and so did bf and his sister. It was in no way disrespectful; Just an old friend keeping a promise 🤝"

170d3mm,170d3mm,bendich,0,1,One funny and enlightening case of delivery in Citymobil,"I periodically use delivery option in cab services. Either Yandex or Citymobil, there is no other in St. Petersburg, Russia. Yesterday I again needed to send a box from downtown to suburbs and I choose a courier in Citymobil (it was cheaper there). Specified the recipient's phone number, pressed a button, 5 minutes and the courier was founded.

The driver arrived, no ""hello"", silently shows the phone with the order, I look at the address - yes, everything is correct, I nod, I explain that the box is full of fragile objects, put on the back seat. I send a link from the app to the recipient, saying ""wait, it's on its way"".

The first alarm bell was when the delivery amount increased from 512 rubles ($17.78) to 781 rubles ($27.11). I think, it is clear, for the expectation tipped, ok, not fatal for me.

The second alarm bell was when the recipient of the delivery wrote that the parcel has not received, and the driver in his application put a mark that all delivered. That is, my parcel is probably still riding in his car.

I call Citymobil, they redirect me to support (it's useless to write in the app, they don't answer, only call), I explain the situation, I say that I'd like to return the parcel at least, they say ""yes, we'll connect with the driver"". And then the worst begins.

The driver picks up the phone and the first thing I hear is a strange cheerful voice says to me ""wait a minute, I need to set up something here"", in that specific voice of robot-callers, you know, you have also received such calls. Then the voice says ""I'm listening to you"", I tell my problem, ask to return the box, and by the answers of the voice from the phone I get a hunch that I'm talking to an application that recognizes my voice, translates it into text, and the person on the other side chooses, depending on what I said, the answer options like ""yes"", ""no"", ""clarify"", in short, people do not talk like that, Turing test failed completely.

I, realizing that the courier driver is deaf-mute, speak into the phone, trying to choose words so that my voice would be correctly recognized and translated into text, but his android app (I remembered that the courier's phone is not iphone) is so dumb that he probably has some nonsense on the screen.

I called Citymobil again, explained the situation, said that your driver was deaf and that there was no way to manage without you. They say to me, ""the company was a partner"", ""non-standard situation, we agree"", ""formally the courier delivered the parcel, we will not return the money"", ""we will deal with your parcel, wait for a decision"".

\- - - - -

It turned out that the deaf-mute driver on the spot could not overcome the barrier with voice communication with the concierge, stood for 30 minutes and went further. The package was returned to me. Dude is really deaf-mute. Smiled and parted."

The last seconds, before his anesthesia kicked in, were of an anesthesiologist, who after administering drugs, leaned close to his ear, and whispered: “you’ll see heaven soon” and winked like some evil doctor (even though he was masked, one could tell he had a smirk on his face). The patient, understandably, got weirded out and scared, but then nurses rolled him onto his stomach and through an opening in the table he saw a taped letters on the floor that read “HEAVEN”. He tried to laugh, but couldn’t, and woke up in the recovery room a few hours later.

I hope it is true as it makes me feel a bit easier around doctors, who pulls pranks like that ))"
